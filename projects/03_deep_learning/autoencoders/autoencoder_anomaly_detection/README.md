# ‚ö° Anomaly Detection in ECG Signals using Autoencoder

This project showcases how to use a **deep autoencoder** in TensorFlow/Keras to detect anomalies in ECG (electrocardiogram) signals. The goal is to train the model on **normal heartbeats** and detect **abnormal** patterns using reconstruction error.

## üìÇ Project Description

The ECG5000 dataset is used to train an autoencoder to reconstruct **normal heartbeats**. The idea is that abnormal signals will have a **higher reconstruction error** since the model has never seen them during training.

The reconstruction error is then compared to a threshold (determined via F1 score) to classify signals as **normal** or **abnormal**.

## ‚úÖ Steps for Analysis

1. **Data Loading**:
   - ECG signals are loaded from a CSV file hosted online.
   - Labels are separated from input features.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Only normal signals are used for training.
   - The test set includes both normal and abnormal samples.
   - Features are standardized using `StandardScaler`.

3. **Model Building**:
   - A symmetrical deep autoencoder with three encoding and three decoding layers.
   - ReLU activations in hidden layers; sigmoid in output layer.

4. **Training**:
   - The model is trained with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and Adam optimizer.
   - Early stopping is used to prevent overfitting by monitoring validation loss.

5. **Reconstruction Error & Thresholding**:
   - Reconstruction error is calculated for the test set.
   - The optimal threshold is determined by maximizing the F1 score.

6. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are reported.
   - Loss curves and error distributions are visualized for insight.
