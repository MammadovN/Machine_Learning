## üìÇ Project Description

This project demonstrates how to perform image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch.

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images labeled across 10 categories:
- Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck

The goal is to train a deep learning model that can accurately identify the class of a given image based on learned features through convolutional layers.

## ‚úÖ Steps for Analysis

1. **Data Loading**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is downloaded and loaded using `torchvision.datasets`.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: All images are normalized to have pixel values between -1 and 1, improving model convergence.
3. **Exploratory Visualization**: A batch of sample images is visualized along with their class labels to understand the data.
4. **CNN Model Building**:
   - A simple CNN is constructed with two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and dropout.
   - Fully connected layers are added to map features to the output classes.
5. **Model Training**:
   - The model is trained using CrossEntropyLoss and the Adam optimizer.
   - Training loss and test accuracy are tracked over 10 epochs.
6. **Evaluation**:
   - The model is evaluated using a confusion matrix, classification report (precision, recall, F1-score), and accuracy metric.
   - Loss and accuracy curves are plotted to visualize learning.
7. **Sample Predictions**:
   - The model makes predictions on a batch of test images, which are visualized alongside true labels.
8. **Optional Improvements**:
   - Techniques such as data augmentation, batch normalization, or deeper networks can be explored to boost performance.
