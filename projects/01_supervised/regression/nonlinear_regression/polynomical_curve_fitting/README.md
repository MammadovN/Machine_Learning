# Polynomial Curve Fitting with Random Forest

## Project Overview:
This project demonstrates **polynomial curve fitting** using the **Random Forest Regressor** model. The goal is to fit a **nonlinear curve** to a synthetic dataset that exhibits a quadratic relationship, using a **Random Forest** model to make predictions based on polynomial features.

In this project:
- A **synthetic dataset** is generated with a quadratic relationship and noise.
- Polynomial features are created from the input data to model the nonlinear relationship.
- The **Random Forest Regressor** is used to fit the polynomial curve and make predictions.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data manipulation and model building.
- **NumPy**: Used for generating random data and mathematical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization and plotting the fitted curve.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for implementing **Random Forest Regressor** and **PolynomialFeatures** for feature transformation.
