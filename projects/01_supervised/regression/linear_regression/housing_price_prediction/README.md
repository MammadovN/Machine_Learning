# Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview:
This project applies **linear regression** to predict housing prices using the **Boston Housing dataset**. The dataset includes various features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and property tax rate to estimate the median value of homes in a neighborhood.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** for model building
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for visualization

## How to Run the Project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
2. **Install required libraries**:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the Python script**: The model is implemented in housing_price_prediction.py. You can run the script like so:
  ```bash
  python housing_price_prediction.py
