# üìà Stock Price Prediction

An end-to-end time-series forecasting project that builds and evaluates models to predict future stock prices. Includes data ingestion, feature engineering, model training (classical and deep learning), evaluation, and a simple backtest/demo.

## üìÇ Project Description

This project is structured into three main stages:

1. **Baseline Models**  
   - **ARIMA Forecasting**: Fit an ARIMA(p,d,q) model on historical closing prices (`statsmodels`).  
   - **Linear Regression**: Train a regression model on lagged and technical features (`scikit-learn`).  
   - **Evaluation**: Compute MAE and RMSE on the test split to quantify forecasting error.

2. **Deep Learning Model**  
   - **LSTM Network**: Build a two-layer LSTM with Dropout for sequential modeling (`TensorFlow 2`).  
   - **Data Preparation**: Scale features (Close, MA_10, MA_50, Return, RSI_14), create sliding windows of length 20.  
   - **Training**: Use early stopping on validation loss, monitor MSE during training.

3. **Inference & Deployment**  
   - **Model Saving**: Persist trained ARIMA, Linear Regression, and LSTM models to disk.  
   - **`predict_next()` API**: Load models and scaler, take the most recent window to forecast the next-day closing price.

## ‚úÖ Steps for Analysis

1. **Data Loading**  
   - Download daily OHLCV data for AAPL from 2015-01-01 to 2025-01-01 via `yfinance`.  
   - Select only the ‚ÄúClose‚Äù column and drop any missing values.  

2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
   - Compute 10-day and 50-day moving averages on the Close price.  
   - Calculate daily returns as percentage change.  
   - Derive a 14-period RSI indicator.  
   - Remove all rows with NaNs resulting from rolling/window calculations.  

3. **Model Training**  
   - **ARIMA**: Fit an ARIMA(5,1,0) model on the training Close series.  
   - **Linear Regression**: Train on lagged Close and engineered features.  
   - **LSTM**: Build a sequence model, train with validation split and early stopping (restore best weights).  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Compute MAE and RMSE for each model‚Äôs predictions on the test set.  
   - Visualize actual vs. predicted price series to compare performance.  

5. **Model Saving & Inference**  
   - Persist the Linear Regression model, LSTM model file, and any scalers to disk.  
   - Load saved artifacts and run a helper function to forecast the next trading day‚Äôs price.
