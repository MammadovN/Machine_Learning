# Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest, LOF, and One-Class SVM

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in data using multiple anomaly detection algorithms. The goal is to identify outliers or unusual behaviors in the dataset using three popular techniques: **Isolation Forest**, **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**, and **One-Class SVM**.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data processing and model training.
- **Google Colab**: An interactive environment used for running Python code and data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and transformations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations of the data.
- **Seaborn**: For creating enhanced visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model building, including anomaly detection algorithms (Isolation Forest, LOF, One-Class SVM).
