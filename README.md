## Projects

### Supervised Learning
- **[Credit Card Fraud Detection](projects/01_supervised/anomaly_detection/fraud_detection/README.md)**:Fraudulent credit card transactions based on features such as transaction time, amount, and anonymized user data. Key considerations include handling class imbalance with **SMOTE**, applying log transformation and scaling to features like `Amount`, and using models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**, which are evaluated based on metrics like **ROC-AUC** and **PR-AUC** due to the imbalanced dataset.
- **[Polynomical Curve Fitting](projects/01_supervised/regression/nonlinear_regression/polynomical_curve_fitting/README.md)**: A polynomial regression model is fitted using Random Forest after transforming the input features into polynomial terms for non-linear curve fitting.
- **[House Price Prediction](projects/01_supervised/regression/linear_regression/housing_price_prediction/README.md)**: Predicting house prices using linear regression.
- **[German Credit Risk Classification](projects/01_supervised/classification/credit_risk_classification/README.md)**: Predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using various machine learning models.
- **[Customer Churn Prediction](projects/01_supervised/classification/customer_churn_prediction/README.md)**: Predicting credit risk for a financial institution using various machine learning models, with missing values and a mix of categorical (e.g., job, purpose) and numerical (e.g., age, credit amount) features.
- **[Text Classification Model for News Categories](projects/01_supervised/classification/text_classification/README.md)**: Building a text classification model to categorize news articles into predefined categories using machine learning and NLP techniques.
- **[Fashion MNIST Model Comparison](projects/01_supervised/classification/image_classification/README.md)**: Comparing different machine learning models on the Fashion MNIST dataset, including KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
### Unsupervised Learning
- **[Anomaly Detection](projects/02_unsupervised/anomaly_detection/fraud_detection/README.md)**: Detecting anomalies in data using multiple anomaly detection algorithms. The goal is to identify outliers or unusual behaviors in the dataset using three popular techniques: **Isolation Forest**, **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**, and **One-Class SVM**.
- **[Customer Segmentation Clustering](projects/02_unsupervised/clustering/customer_segmentation/README.md)**: Using **K-Means**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, and **DBSCAN** algorithms to segment customers based on their demographic and spending behavior, helping businesses develop targeted marketing strategies and personalized offers.
- **[PCA & t-SNE Visualization](projects/02_unsupervised/dimensionality_reduction/pca_tsne_visualization/README.md)**: Using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)** to reduce the dimensionality of the **Iris dataset** and visualize the results in 2D.
